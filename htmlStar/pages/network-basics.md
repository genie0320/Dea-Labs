# Misc.

### Ports
- Alternatively, since ```127.0.0.1``` is aliased with 'localhost', you could also enter ```localhost:5500```.
- Websites are typically served on ports 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS)
- You can use ANY ports that are typically not used by any other processes - 5500, 3000 or 8080 are common choices because they aren't typically used by other processes.
